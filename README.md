# RemoteWget

Very simple windows forms application for starting background wget on your linux machine.
I created this last night so I dont have to login using ssh every time I want to wget something on server.

This is very basic no fancy stuff just gets job done.

Please fork, improve and make pull request. Thanks!

Use at your own risk!
